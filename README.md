# FlappyBirdANN
This was my attempt at machine learning during 12th grade. It masters the game in a couple of minutes to the extent that the birds never die.

**Disclaimer:** If you're someone who is trying find a hint or two regarding the subject and unlucky enough to be dwelling here, I advise you to stop.
The implementation is very messy, in the sense that it needs much more abstraction. The control statement is one giant block with no helper functions whatsoever. 
Neurons aren't objects of an appropriate class but rather tons of variables lying around with unitelligible names such as h1, h2, h3. 
But I didn't know better back then and I can't bother changing it at this point.
